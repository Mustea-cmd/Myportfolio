# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The application uses a modern React-based architecture with the following key design decisions:

- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing, chosen for its minimal footprint over React Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library following the "new-york" style variant, providing consistent design system and dark/light theme support
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management, eliminating the need for complex state management libraries
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive shadcn/ui component system with Radix UI primitives for accessibility

## Backend Architecture
The backend follows a simple Express.js server architecture:

- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript for consistent typing across the application
- **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints following conventional HTTP methods
- **Data Storage**: In-memory storage implementation with interface-based design allowing easy migration to database storage
- **Request Handling**: Centralized error handling and request/response logging middleware
- **Development Setup**: Hot reload capabilities with Vite integration for seamless development experience

## Data Storage Solutions
Currently implements a simple in-memory storage pattern:

- **Storage Interface**: Abstract IStorage interface defining methods for user and contact message operations
- **Memory Implementation**: MemStorage class providing immediate functionality without database dependencies
- **Database Ready**: Drizzle ORM configuration prepared for PostgreSQL migration when needed
- **Schema Definition**: Shared schema definitions between client and server using Drizzle and Zod for validation

## Authentication and Authorization
The application architecture includes preparation for authentication:

- **User Schema**: Defined user model with username and password fields
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL session store configuration (connect-pg-simple) prepared for implementation
- **Security**: Password hashing and validation patterns ready for implementation

## External Dependencies

- **shadcn/ui**: Component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives for complex UI elements
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library for smooth transitions and interactions
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography

### Data Management
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management and caching
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe SQL query builder and ORM
- **Zod**: Schema validation for runtime type checking
- **React Hook Form**: Form state management with @hookform/resolvers for validation

### Database and Storage
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL database (@neondatabase/serverless)
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database system
- **connect-pg-simple**: PostgreSQL session store for Express sessions

### Development and Build Tools
- **ESBuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler for production builds
- **PostCSS**: CSS post-processing with Autoprefixer
- **Various Radix UI Components**: Comprehensive set of accessible UI primitives

### Utility Libraries
- **date-fns**: Date manipulation and formatting
- **clsx**: Conditional CSS class names
